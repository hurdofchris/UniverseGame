Generate a distribution of masses consistent with Baryon Acoustic Oscillaions after the Expansion Period of the Big Bang. For the calculated universe radius, take the longest distance that a player could travel at full warp with a straight route if the game simulated it 24/7 for 100 real years and multiply it by 5. This is to ensure that any distance covered by the player would be simulated realistically and wouldn't show edge artifacts for gravitational calulations. For even more improved accuracy, estimate the gravitational effects that some masses of full BAOs outside of the barrier would have on the simulated section and add the effects in statically.

Simulate expansion and gravity for a set amount of time.
