# Persistence
The universe will persist. This brings some great immersive capabilities, but also creates some challenges.

Because the universe persists, everything is constantly in motion. It makes things feel dynamic, not static or preset.

Part of the immersion is to make the player feel like they are the character that they are playing. One problem with this could happen in a permadeath situation where a player's character dies and they need to create a new one. The problem is with the fact that the player will keep their memories of the universe. Things like hidden bases, codes, passwords, caches, etc. will persist in the player's mind. The challenge is to find a sensible way for these memories to persist across characters. Dreams?
