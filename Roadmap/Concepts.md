## Life on Planets Deemed Uninhabitable
Rare occurence where life inexplicably appeared and is thriving.

## Celestial Bodies
Add concepts like:
* Tidal forces
  * Roche limit
  * Orbital resonance
  * Tidal locking
  * Tidal heating
  * Lithospheric effects
  * Hydrospheric effects
  * Atmospheric effects
* Ring and belt systems
* Stellar wind

## Technology
### Wormholes
To create a wormhole, you need to start with a black hole. You also need a negative energy device (dark matter). Need to figure out how to link black holes for a wormhole. The negative energy device sustains the wormhole. Bigger black holes required for longer distances. Multiple exits for one entrance?
