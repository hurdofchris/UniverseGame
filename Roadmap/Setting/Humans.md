Humans explored a sizable portion of the galaxy and have even colonized a few dozen planets and moons whether they were terraformed or initially habitable. There are also hundreds of stations of various sizes distributed throughout many of these same star systems. Lastly there is one tremendous ring colony orbiting a G-type main-sequence star. This colony is the prime achievement of humankind and serves as the "human capital of the universe".

Humanity has discovered ways to safely create and store mass amounts of antimatter for power generation. They've also invented the warp drive and very recently discovered how to extend their warp capabilities to travel unimaginable distances. The greatest challenge to interstellar/intergalactic travel has become finding safe routes to warp through without interruption.

They've also discovered a way to clone organisms very precisely. In doing so they discovered several other things. They found that consciousness consists of an arrangement of dark matter. They pressed on to learn how to manipulate dark matter and discovered a lot of physics beyond the standard model. They eventually learned how to copy consciousness, but at a price. During experimentation with cloning they were able to the entire being: body, memories, and to an extent, personality. But something was missing. Somehow a person that was cloned was not the same person. They were more of a robot or a husk of the person with no sense of morality. This will be the antagonist of the story. So there still seems to be something unknown beyond consciousness itself. The humans discovered that they could "move the soul" if the original was entangled with it and the original person expired, meaning the clone was in the opposite quantum state. The transmission of the soul is seemingly instantaneous, so if the person expires, the clone immediately wakes up. This can effectively make someone immortal.

The antagonist is somehow interfering with soul transfer? They learned the physics of the dark universe where the soul exists?
