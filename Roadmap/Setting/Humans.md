Humans explored a sizable portion of the galaxy and have even colonized a few dozen planets and moons whether they were terraformed or initially habitable. There are also hundreds of stations of various sizes distributed throughout many of these same star systems. Lastly there is one tremendous ring colony orbiting a G-type main-sequence star. This colony is the prime achievement of humankind and serves as the "human capital of the universe".
