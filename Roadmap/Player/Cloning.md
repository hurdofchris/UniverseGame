# Cloning
###### Humans have attained immortality through a bit of luck and a lot of consequence.

As a gameplay mechanic, respawn upon death happens through cloning. Prior to beginning any journey a traveler must have a clone ready unless they resolve to continue without one. The clone's dark matter component is entangled to the player's dark matter component so that when the wave function collapses due to the death of the player, the clone will be activated and the player's soul will (nearly) instantly be transported to the clone.

Traveling without an entangled clone ready is basically playing in permadeath mode.

Something unique about the player? Ability to retain knowledge across different lives (not cloned)?
