# Rescue
Rescue is a mechanic that helps the player return from situations where they are stuck. Players have to pay in-game currency to be rescued and the price varies by several factors.

## Player Interaction

### Vessels
Most vessels come equipped with a transponder that specifically interacts with Rescue Warp Communications. The vessel's Universal Positioning System will also have charts of Rescue Space Zones. These vessels will usually have cockpit lights equipped to inform the pilot of their position inside (or outside) of rescue space.

## Zones

### Regulated Rescue Space (RRS)
###### Within this space, rescue is a regulated industry that has set costs and standards for risk and effort.

#### Distance from a Rescue Outpost
This is a sliding scale price that covers the cost of fuel to and from the rescue point.

#### Hazards
There are different types of hazards that could influence the price of rescue.
##### Environmental
The rescue point could obstructed or in the middle of an environmental hazard. These could include asteroid fields; dangerous radiation levels; dangerous plantary atmosphere, lithosphere, cryosphere, or hydrospheres; and intense gravity wells. Rescue vessels need to be equipped to deal with these hazards.
##### Hostile
The rescue point is in an area well-known for hostile activity. The requires extra security.
##### Uncharted
The rescue point is in uncharted space so precautions of every kind need to be exercised.


#### Priority
##### Standby
This is the lowest priority. A standby rescue mission can be postponed even after dispatch if a high/emergency priority mission comes in.
##### Standard
A standard mission will undergo an analysis with back-and-forth communication between the stranded party and the rescue team. Once the stranded party has agreed to the conditions, the rescue team will be dispatched. A standard mission cannot be cancelled after dispatch except if an emergency request comes in.
##### High
A high priority mission is the same as a standard mission but with increased priority. Any pending high priority missions must be dispatched before any lower priority missions. High priority doesn't supercede standard missions.
##### Emergency
An emergency mission is dispatched immediately upon receiving communication from the stranded vessel taking the most optimal route for safety and speed. The stranded vessel is taken to a safe rally point where the rest of the mission can be assessed. The rally point will be equipped with a mobile medical vessel, extra security, and failsafe comms.
##### Critical Emergency
These missions are on a short time constraint, meaning the vessel and/or occupants need the quickest attention possible. They supercede every other priority from or after dispatch except Emergency priority, which only takes priority after dispatch. These missions will disregard any cautions they can without significantly jeopardizing the success of the mission. The primary vessel is auto-dispatched and auto-piloted unless overriden by the pilot. Like emergency missions the stranded vessel is taken to a safe rally point where the rest of the mission can be assessed. The rally point will be equipped with a mobile medical vessel, extra security, and failsafe comms.

### Voluntary Rescue Space (VRS)
###### Within this space, rescue is handled on a volunteer basis. Travelers are warned to travel with utmost caution as voluntary rescue could take a long time or sometimes may never come. Pricing for rescue is negotiated between the parties involved and does not fall under RRS standards.
