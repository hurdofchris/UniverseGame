# UniverseGame
###### An open-source game that simulates the universe and allows players to do practically anything.
---
This is the prototype for the repository. A new one may be created once a proper license is decided on.

There are three main sections of the repository:
1. Meta

    This is where anything regarding the repository itself is defined, including the main sections of the repository. This Readme is contained with the Meta section. It can contain rules (for submission, etc.), information about the license, etc. Users can submit requests to change the Meta, like adding/changing the license, elected moderators, sections within the repository, this README file, etc.

2. Roadmap

    This is "instruction manual" for the implementation. Features of the game are defined here. Users can submit their ideas for different parts of the game. They will be vetted and included if they fit the overall vision of the game.
    
3. Implementation

    This is where developers can submit code to fulfill items from the roadmap. Documentation of the feature details and how the code fulfills it should be in code comments.
