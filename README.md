# UniverseGame
###### An open-source game that simulates the universe and allows players to do practically anything.
---
This is the prototype for the repository. A new one may be created once a proper license is decided on.


## Structure
There are three main sections of the repository:
### Meta

This is where anything regarding the repository itself is defined, including the main sections of the repository. This Readme is contained with the Meta section. It can contain rules (for submission, etc.), information about the license, etc. Users can submit requests to change the Meta, like adding/changing the license, elected moderators, sections within the repository, this README file, etc.

### Roadmap

This is "instruction manual" for the implementation. Features of the game are defined here. Users can submit their ideas for different parts of the game. They will be vetted and included if they fit the overall vision of the game.
    
### Implementation

This is where developers can submit code to fulfill items from the roadmap. Documentation of the feature details and how the code fulfills it should be in code comments. Development will currently proceed using trunk-based development.


## Community
Anyone can contribute to the development of this game. Contributions will be vetted by moderators to ensure they maintain the spirit of the game.

### Funding and Incentives
There will be a Patreon that people can donate to. Funds will be dispersed to contributors based on the type of contribution they make.

#### 3D Assets

A 3D artist may develop an asset and submit it for review. If accepted into the game, they would receive a payout based on the asset type and quality.

#### Code

A feature could have a incentive attached to it. Feature submissions will be considered in order of submission date. The most elegant code out of the first 10 working submissions will be chosen for QA. QA will consist of a battery of tests. Every defect found in the code will reduce the payout of the feature by 10%. This reduction will be paid out to the 50/50 to the QA that discovered the defect and to the developer that fixes it.
